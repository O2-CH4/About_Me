### • Museum Tour USA (Summer 2022)

- Drove 20 000 km in 2 weeks to visit 20-30 aerospace/energy/science museums across almost all USA states.
- Some pictures:

### • [Stochastic Simulation and Design of Intelligent Systems](link:____) (Summer 2022)

- Did 2 interesting projects in the context of a graduate course named "Design & Simulation of Intelligent Systems for the 4.0 Industry"

A) Monte-Carlo Simulations for Optimal Scenario Assessment (Robotic Automation of Port Activities)
- Question: Which robotic automation investment is the most optimal to do given some statistical distributions of the maritime traffic.
- We simulated each possible scenario according to some assumed distributions (Inverse Transform Method)

B) Simulation and Optimization of Wood Drying through Deep Reinforcement Learning

- Overview: Research Project in partnership with a wood drying company active in North America 
- Goal: Assess the potential of Deep-Reinforcement-Learning combined with a detailed simulator (Digital Twin) for industrial optimization.
- Details: The complex simulation environment was created using Open AI Gym & Simpy in order to reproduce part of the operation processes. Then, a Deep-RL agent was trained to allocate efficiently some resources that are part of the industrial process operations. I directed the team towards choosing Deep-RL & Simulation-Learning as I really think this represents the future of robotics via sim-to-real transfer for efficiently training and optimizing robotic controllers/industrial processes. (Ex: Open AI -- Rubik Cube Solving, Nvidia-ETH Zurich -- Learning to Walk in Minutes Using Massively Parallel Deep-RL). PPO + Reward Engineering Technique "Heuristic-Guided Reinforcement Learning" were used.







### • [Information Theory (diverse files)] (Winter 2022)

- Devoir 1
- Devoir 2
- Devoir 3
- Devoir 4

- Submitted problems worth 40% of the session for the graduate course on Information Theory I took.






### • [Neural Combinatorial Solver Project (WTA Deep-RL)](link:____) (Winter 2022)

- **Context**: Combinatorial Optimization Graduate course 
- **Overview**: Me and two other students realized a project relating the trade-offs made when using end-to-end neural solvers instead of traditional solving methods for combinatorial optimization problems. 
- **Details**: Neural Solvers approximate/learn an end-to-end policy that take a problem instance as input and output directly a solution to our problem that ideally optimize a desired objective function(s) and respect a set of constraints.  Problems can be Permutation or Assignment-based. In our work, we focused on comparing the results of a Graph Attention Neural Network architecture and a traditional solver on a specific assignment problem: The Weapon-Target Assignment (WTA). This defense-related problem seeks to assign interceptor (or missiles) from different weapon systems to targets in order to minimize the total expected destructive value of those incoming targets. We used reinforcement learning to parametrize our neural solver in order to learn an optimal policy, where the reward was the negative of the total expected destructive value of all targets after an assignment. If Supervised learning was used, we could say that the optimal policy was approximated. Solutions were generated autoregressively by our model at inference time. 



### • [Critical Temperature Prediction for Superconducting Materials](link:____) (Fall 2021)

- **Context**: Graduate ML Course
- **Overview**: Project article on a data-driven approach for critical temperature (Tc) prediction of superconducting materials. 
- **Details**: Deep Neural Network models were used as surrogate models to learn the mapping between the features of known superconducting materials and their respective critical temperature (Tc) observed in laboratory.  A dataset of 21 263 superconductors was used with 82 attributes per superconductor, including characteristics of the materials such as the number of elements that compose them, their average atomic weights and the entropy of their atomic masses.



### • [Theory behind ML Models + Code Implementations](link:____) (Summer 2021)  

- Took 1 month of my summer to create an 80 pages documents on all the main Machine Learning Models (Theory + Code)
- The content was extracted from 20 books and multiple papers/blogs (Used Jupiter Notebooks and Python)
- Eventually served many friends looking to prepare themselves for the graduate ML course
- Also did a similar small document on the topic of Mathematical Modeling in order to introduce myself to some Julia implementations


## 4) Education 

- College Stanislas
- Grad-skipped one year
