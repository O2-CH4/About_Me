# About Me





## 1) Overview:

- Canadian AI Graduate Student 
- Currently following 2 courses in Montreal: Quantum Computing and Theoretical Principles of Deep Learning. 
- Student with interdisciplinary interests that is strongly driven to understand complex problems and create utility for others.





## 2) Interests:

- Applying new tools from AI/Statistics to problems in Science & Engineering. 




## 3) Repository for Diverse Projects/Files:


• [Theory behind ML Models + Code Implementations (Summer 2021)] (link)

- Took 1 month of my summer to create an 80 pages documents on all the main Machine Learning Models (Theory + Code)
- The content was extracted from 20 books and multiple papers/blogs (Used Jupiter Notebooks and Python)
- Eventually served many friends looking to prepare themselves for the graduate ML course
- Also did a similar small document on the topic of Mathematical Modeling in order to introduce myself to some Julia implementations


•	[Critical Temperature Prediction for Superconducting Materials](https://github.com/O2 CH4/About_Me/blob/main/Critical%20Temperature%20Prediction%20for%20Superconducting%20Materials%20(EN).pdf) (Fall 2021)

- Context: Graduate ML Course
- Overview: Project article on a data-driven approach for critical temperature (Tc) prediction of superconducting materials. 
- Details: Deep Neural Network models were used as surrogate models to learn the mapping between the features of known superconducting materials and their respective critical temperature (Tc) observed in laboratory.  A dataset of 21 263 superconductors was used with 82 attributes per superconductor, including characteristics of the materials such as the number of elements that compose them, their average atomic weights and the entropy of their atomic masses.
